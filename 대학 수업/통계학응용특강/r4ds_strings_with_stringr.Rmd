# 1. String basics

## Create a string

We will focus on the `stringr` package for string manipulation, which is part of the core tidyverse.


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

-   To create strings, use either single quotes `'` or double quotes
    `"`.

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If I want to include a 
"quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'
```

-   If you forget to close quote, you'll see `+`, the continuation
    character.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    "This is a string without a closing quote
    +
    +
    + HELP I'M STUCK

-   If this happen, press `Esc` to "escape" it.

## Escape

-   Including quotes and backslash

```{r}
double_quote <- "\"" 
single_quote <- '\'' 
backslash <- "\\"
```

-   To see the raw contents of the string, use `writeLines()`

```{r}
x <- c(single_quote, double_quote, backslash)
x
writeLines(x)
```

## Raw strings

-   Consider a string with multiple quotes or backslashes.

```{r}
tricky <- "double_quote <- \"\\\"\" # or '\"'
single_quote <- '\\'' # or \"'\""
writeLines(tricky)
```

-   A raw string usually starts with `r"(` and finishes with `)"`.

```{r}
tricky <- r"(double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'")"
writeLines(tricky)
```

-   If your string contains `)"`, instead use `r"[]"` or `r"{}"`, or any
    number of dashes with `()` e.g. `` `r"--()--" ``,
    `` `r"---()---" ``.

```{r}
temp <-r"[this contains () ]"
writeLines(temp)
temp2 <- r"--(this contains (--) )--"
writeLines(temp2)
```

## Other special characters

-   newline: `\n`
-   tab: `\t`
-   Unicodes escapes that start with `\u` or `\U`.

```{r}
special_chr<-"This sentence \t contains \n some special characters such as \u00b5 and \U0001f604"
writeLines(special_chr)
```

-   To see complete list of other special characters, type `?'"'`.

# 2. Creating many strings from data

## `str_c()`

-   `str_c()` takes any number of vectors as arguments and returns a
    character vector:
-   `str_c()` is very similar to the base `paste0()`.

```{r}
str_c("x", "y")
str_c("x", "y","z", sep=",")
str_c("Hello ", c("John", "Susan"), sep= ",")
str_c("Hello ", c("John", "Susan"), collapse= ",")
```

-   `str_c()` is designed to be used with `mutate()` so it obeys the
    usual rules for recycling and missing values:

```{r}
set.seed(1410)
df <- tibble(name = c(wakefield::name(3), NA))
df |> mutate(greeting = str_c("Hi ", name, "!"))
```

-   If you want missing values to display in some other way, use
    `coalesce()` either inside or outside of `str_c()`:

```{r}
df |> mutate(
  greeting1 = str_c("Hi ", coalesce(name, "you"), "!"),
  greeting2 = coalesce(str_c("Hi ", name, "!"), "Hi!"))
```

## `str_glue()`

-   `str_glue()` provides an alternative approach. Anything inside `{}`
    will be evaluated like it's outside of the string:

```{r}
df |> mutate(greeting = str_glue("Hi {name}!"))
```

-   If you need to include a regular `{` or `}` in your string, double
    up the special characters:

```{r}
df |> mutate(greeting = str_glue("{{Hi {name}!}}"))
```

## `str_flatten()`

-   It takes a character vector and combines each element of the vector
    into a single string:

```{r}
str_flatten(c("x", "y", "z"))
str_flatten(c("x", "y", "z"), ", ")
str_flatten(c("x", "y", "z"), collapse=", ")
```

-   This makes it work well with `summarise()`:

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~ name, ~ fruit,
  "Carmen", "banana",
  "Carmen", "apple",
  "Marvin", "nectarine",
  "Terence", "cantaloupe",
  "Terence", "papaya",
  "Terence", "madarine"
)
df |>
  group_by(name) |> 
  summarise(fruits = str_flatten(fruit, ", "))
df%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarise(fruits = str_c(fruit,collapse = ","))
```

-   The base `R` equivalent is `paste()` used with the `collapse`
    argument.

# 3. Letters

## String Length

\-`str_length()` : the number of characters in a string

```{r}
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
# In BASE 
length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
x <- c("a", "R for data science", NA)
x[2]; length(strsplit(x[2][[1]],"")[[1]])
```

## Subsetting Strings

\-`str_sub(string, start, end)`

```{r}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x,  1,  3)
```

-   Negative numbers count backwards from end

```{r}
str_sub(x, start=-3, end=-1) # substr (x)
```

-   It will just return as much as possible

```{r}
str_sub("a", 1, 5)
```

## Locales

-   Change case

```{r}
dog <- "The quick brown dog"
str_to_upper(dog)
str_to_lower(dog)
str_to_title(dog)
```

-   Turkish has two i's : with and without a dot, and it has a different
    rule for capitalizing them :

```{r}
x<-c("i", "Ä±")
str_to_upper(x)
str_to_upper(x, locale = "tr")
```

-   `str_sort()` and `str_order()` sort vectors in alphabetical order,
    but the alphabet is not the same in all languages

```{r}
str_sort(c("a","b", "c", "ch", "e", "h"))
str_sort(c("a","b", "c", "ch", "e", "h"), locale = "cs") #Czech Republic
str_sort(c("a","b", "c", "ch", "e", "h"), locale = "haw") #Hawaiian
```

-   The locale is specified as an ISO 639 language code.
-   To see available locales, type `?stringi::stri_locale_list()`

# 4. Matching Patterns with Regulars Expressions

## Regexps

**Regexps** are a very terse language that allow you to describe
patterns in strings.

![](img/regexp1.png)

![](img/regexp2.png)

## Basic Matches

-   `str_view()`, `str_view_all()` take a character vector and a regular
    expression, and show how they match.

-   The simplest patterns match exact strings:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an",T)
```

-   The next step up in complexity is `.`, which matches any character :

```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

- To create the regular expression `\.` we need the string `\\.`

```{r}
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)
#> \.
```

```{r}
# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

-   To match a literal `\`, use four backslashes.

```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
#> a\b

str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

## Anchors

*anchor* matches from the start or end of the string.

-   \^ to match the start of the string.
-   \$ to match the end of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
str_view(x, "a$")
```

-   To force a regular expression to only match a complete string,
    anchor it with both \^ and \$ :

```{r}
x<- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

## Alternates

-   `[abc]` matches a, b, or c.
-   `[a-z]` matches every character between `a` and `z`
-   `[^abc]`matches anything except a, b, or c.

```{r}
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[.]c")
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), ".[*]c")
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[ ]")
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a.c")
```

- You can use *alternation* to pick between one or more alternative
patterns.

- For example, abc\|def will match either "abc", or "def".

```{r}
str_view(c("grey","gray"),"gr(e|a)y")
```

## Character Classes

There are a number of special patterns that match more than one
character.

-   `\d` matches any digit.
-   The complement, `\D` matches any character that is not a decimal
    digit.

```{r}
str_extract_all("1 + 2 = 3", "\\d+")[[1]]
```

```{r}
str_extract_all("1 + 2 = 3", "\\D+")[[1]]
```

-   `\s` matches any whitespace (e.g., space, tab, newline).
-   The complement, `\S` matches any non-whitespace character

```{r}
(text <- "Some  \t badly\n\t\tspaced \f text")
str_extract_all(text, "\\s+", " ")
str_extract_all(text, "\\S+",simplify = T)
str_extract_all(text, "\\S+","")
```

-   `\w` matches any "word" character, which includes alphabetic
    characters, marks and decimal numbers.

-   The complement, `\W`, matches any non-word character.

```{r}
str_extract_all("Don't eat that!", "\\w+")[[1]]
str_extract_all("Don't eat that!", "\\W")[[1]]
```

-   `\b` matches word boundaries, the transition between word and
    non-word characters.

-   The complement, `\B` matches the opposite: boundaries that have
    either both word or non-word characters on either side.

```{r}
str_replace_all("The quick brown fox", "\\b", "_")
str_replace_all("The quick brown fox", "\\B", "*")
```

## Pre-built classes

-   `[:punct:]`: punctuation.
-   `[:alpha:]`: letters.
-   `[:lower:]`: lowercase letters.
-   `[:upper:]`: upperclass letters.
-   `[:digit:]`: digits.
-   `[:xdigit:`]: hex digits.
-   `[:alnum:]`: letters and numbers.
-   `[:cntrl:]`: control characters.
-   `[:graph:]`: letters, numbers, and punctuation.
-   `[:print:]`: letters, numbers, punctuation, and whitespace.
-   `[:space:]`: space characters (basically equivalent to \s).
-   `[:blank:]`: space and tab.

## Special Characters

| string (type this) | regexp (to mean this) |        mathches (which matches this)         |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|       `\\.`        |         `\.`          |                     `.`                      |
|       `\\!`        |         `\!`          |              `!` (`\?` for `?`)              |
|       `\\\\`       |         `\\`          |                     `\`                      |
|       `\\(`        |         `\(`          |  `(` (`\),\{,\}` for `),{,}`, respectively)  |
|       `\\n`        |         `\n`          |              new line (return)               |
|       `\\t`        |         `\t`          |                     tab                      |
|       `\\s`        |         `\s`          |  any white space (`\S` fornon-whitespaces)   |
|       `\\d`        |         `\d`          |        any digit (`\D` for non-digits        |
|       `\\w`        |         `\w`          | any word character (`\S` for non-word chars) |
|       `\\b`        |         `\b`          |  word boundaries (`\B` for non-boundaries)   |


## Quantifiers

-   ? : 0 or 1
-   $+$ : 1 or more
-   $*$ : 0 or more

```{r}
x<- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
str_view(x, "CC+")
str_view(x, "C[LX]+")
```

## Quantifiers

- We can also specify the number of matches precisely :

-   { n } : exactly n
-   {n, } : n or more
-   {, m} : at most m
-   {n,m} : between n and m

```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2}")
str_view(x,"C{2,}")
str_view(x,"C{2,3}")
```

- By default these matches are "greedy": they will match the longest string possible. You can make them "lazy", matching the shortest string possible by putting a `?` after them:

-   `??`: 0 or 1, prefer 0.
-   `+?`: 1 or more, match as few times as possible.
-   `*?`: 0 or more, match as few times as possible.
-   `{n,}?`: n or more, match as few times as possible.
-   `{n,m}?`: between n and m, match as few times as possible, but at
    least n.

```{r}
str_extract(x, c("C{2,3}", "C{2,3}?"))
str_extract(x, c("C[LX]+", "C[LX]+?"))
```

## Look Arounds

-   `a(?=c)` : followed by
-   `a(?!c)` :not followed by
-   `(?<=b)a` : preceded by
-   `(?\<!b)a` : not preceded by

```{r}
x<-"bacad"
str_view_all(x,"a(?=c)")
str_view_all(x,"a(?!c)")
str_view_all(x,"(?<=b)a")
str_view_all(x,"(?<!b)a")
```

```{r}
x <- c("1 piece", "2 pieces", "3")
str_extract(x, "\\d+(?= pieces?)")

y <- c("100", "$400")
str_extract(y, "(?<=\\$)\\d+")
```

## Grouping and Backreferences

They also define "groups" that you can refer to with *backreferences*,
like $\backslash 1$, $\backslash 2$, etc.

```{r}
#All fruits that have a repeated pair of letters
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match=TRUE)
```

# 5. Tools

## Detect Matches

`str_detect()` returns a logical vector the same length as the input

```{r}
x <- c('apple', 'banana', 'pear')
str_detect(x, 'e')
```

```{r}
head(words)
# How many common words strat with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
# What proportion of common words end with a vowel? 
mean(str_detect(words, '[aeiou]$'))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(words)
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
mean(str_detect(words, '[aeiou]$'))
```

-   Two ways to find all words that don't contain any vowels:

```{r}
# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels1 <- !str_detect(words, '[aeiou]')
no_vowels2 <- str_detect(words, '^[^aeiou]+$')
identical(no_vowels1, no_vowels2)
```

-   A common use of \texttt{str\_detect()} is to select the elements
    that match a pattern. We can do this with logical subsetting, or the
    convenient \texttt{str\_subset()} wrapper:

```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
str_subset(words, "x$")
```

- Typically, your strings will be one column of a data frame, and you'll want to use `filter()` instead:
ëªë²ì§¸ì ìëì§ i=seq_along(words)í¨ìë¥¼ íµí´ ì ì ìë¤.

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word <- words,
  i = seq_along(words)
)
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(words, "x$"))
```

A variation on `str_detect()` is `str_count()`: rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string:
[aeiou]ì¤ ëªê°ë¥¼ í¬í¨íê³  ìëì§ str_count
mean : íê· ì ì¼ë¡ íë¨ì ëªê°ì aeiouë¥¼ í¬í¨íëì§ ìììë¤ 
```{r}
# On average, how many vowels per words?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
```

## Extract Matches

`str_extract()` extract the actual text of a match.

-   We use **Harvard sentences** for practicing string manipulations

```{r}
length(sentences)
head(sentences)
```

```{r}
colors <- c("red", "orange","yellow","green","blue","purple")
color_match <- str_c(colors, collapse = "|")
color_match
```
str_subset ì¼ë¡ color_matchìì¸ì ë£ì¼ë©´ ì´ì»¬ë¬ë¤ì´ ìë ë¬¸ì¥ì´ ëì´
str_extract í¨ìë¡ ì´ ì»¬ë¬ë¥¼ ê°ì§ê³  ìì¼ë©´ ê·¸ ì»¬ë¬ë¤ì´ ëì¨ë¤
```{r}
has_color <- str_subset(sentences, color_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_color, color_match)
head(matches)
```

-   Note that `str_extract()` only extracts the **first** match.

```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, color_match)>1]
str_view_all(more, color_match)
```

```{r}
str_extract(more,color_match)
```

`To get all matches, use`str_extract_all()\`

```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, color_match) > 1]
str_extract_all(more, color_match)
```

## Grouped Matches

Imagine we want to extract nouns from the sentences. As a heuristic,
we'll look for any word that comes after "a", "an" or "the". Defining a
"word" in a regular expression is a little tricky, so here I use a
simple approximation a sequence of at least one character that isn't a
space: 

```{r}
noun <- "(a|an|the) ([^ ]+)"
has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun)%>%
  head(20)
has_noun %>%
  str_extract(noun)
```

\-`str_extract()` gives us the complete match, while `str_match()` gives
each individual component. 
ê°ê° nounì ì´ë¤ìì¼ë¡ ë§¤ì¹ëëì§ íì¸íë¤
```{r}
has_noun %>%
  str_match(noun)
```

- If your data is in tibble, it's often easier to use `tidyr::extract()`. 
It works like `str_match()` but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns. 

```{r}
a<-tibble(sentence = sentences) %>%
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, into=c("article", "noun"), "(a|an|the) ([^ ]+)",
    remove = FALSE  ## ì¬ì©ë ì»¬ë¼ì ì ê±°íëì§
  )
```

## Replacing Matches

- `str_replace()`}`and`str_replace_all()\` allow you to replace matches with new strings. The simplest use is to replace a pattern with a fixed string:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

## Splitting

Use `str_split()` to split a string up into pieces. For example, we
could split sentences into words:

```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>%
  str_split(" ")
```

- We can also request a maximum number of pieces:

```{r}
fields <- c("Name: Hadley", "Country: NZ", "Age: 35")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n=2, simplify = TRUE)
```

- Instead of splitting up strings by patterns, you can also split up by character, line, sentence, and word `boundary()`s:

```{r}
x<- "This is a sentence. This is another sentence."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))
```

```{r}
str_split(x, " ")[[1]]
```

```{r}
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```

# 6. Other Types of Pattern

## Other Types of Pattern

-   When you use a pattern that's string, it's automatically wrapped
    into a call to `regex()`:

-   `ignore_case = TRUE` allows characters to match either their
    uppercase or lowercase forms. This always uses the current locale:

```{r}
bananas <-c("banana", "Banana", "BANANA")
str_view(bananas, "banana")
```

```{r}
str_view(bananas, regex("banana", ignore_case = TRUE))
```

-   `multiline = TRUE` allows `^` and `$` to match the start and end of
    each line rather than the start and end of the complete string:

```{r}
x <- "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
str_extract_all(x, "^Line")[[1]]
```

```{r}
str_extract_all(x, regex("^Line", multiline = TRUE))[[1]]
```

-   `comments = TRUE` allows you to use comments and white space to make complex regular expressions more understandable. Spaces are ignored, as is everything after `#`. To match a literal space, you'll need to escape it :`\\\`

```{r}
phone <- regex("
               \\(?     # optional opening parens
               (\\d{3}) # area code
               [)- ]    # optional closing parens, dash, or space
               (\\d{3}) # another three numbers
               [ -]     # optional space or dash
               (\\d{3}) # three more numbers
               ", comments = TRUE)
str_match('123-456-7890', phone)
```
